# Sample marker file for AR PMB Universitas Kuningan
# This is a placeholder for the actual .mind marker file
# In production, you would replace this with an actual MindAR marker file

# To create a proper marker file:
# 1. Visit: https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/tools/compile-target
# 2. Upload your marker image (recommended: high contrast, lots of features)
# 3. Download the generated .mind file
# 4. Replace this file with the generated .mind file

# For now, this file serves as a placeholder to prevent 404 errors
# The application will fall back to simulation mode when this file is used
