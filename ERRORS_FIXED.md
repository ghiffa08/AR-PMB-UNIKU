# 🎉 ERRORS FIXED - AR PMB Application Ready!

## ✅ ISSUES RESOLVED

### 1. **Tailwind CSS PostCSS Configuration Error**
- **Problem**: Conflicting PostCSS plugins and incorrect Tailwind v4 configuration
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed `@tailwindcss/postcss` package that was causing conflicts
  - Created proper `postcss.config.cjs` with standard Tailwind configuration
  - Simplified Vite config to let PostCSS handle Tailwind processing

### 2. **TypeScript Import Errors in App.tsx**
- **Problem**: Cannot find modules for LoadingScreen and IntroScreen
- **Solution**: Added explicit `.tsx` file extensions to imports for better module resolution

### 3. **TypeScript Import Errors in MarkerAR.tsx**
- **Problem**: Cannot find modules for AROverlay and ARControls
- **Solution**: Added explicit `.tsx` file extensions to imports
